            <p class="article-description">If you're seeing "TDS" on your payslip or earning your first salary, you've probably wondered what income tax is. This guide explains the basics in plain language - what it is, who pays it, and what you need to do.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-content">
            <h2>What is Income Tax?</h2>

            <p>Income tax is money you pay to the government based on how much you earn.</p>

            <h3>Simple logic:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>You earn ₹10 lakh/year</li>
                <li>Government says "Give us 10% of that"</li>
                <li>You pay ₹1 lakh as tax</li>
                <li>You keep ₹9 lakh</li>
            </ul>

            <p>That ₹1 lakh funds roads, schools, hospitals, defense, and everything else the government does.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it exists:</strong> Government needs money to run the country. Income tax is one of the biggest sources of that money.</p>

            <p><strong>Reality check:</strong> In 2023-24, India collected ₹19.58 lakh crore from income tax. That's more than the entire GDP of Pakistan.</p>

            <h2>Who Has to Pay Income Tax in India?</h2>

            <h3>Residents of India</h3>

            <p>If you live in India for more than 182 days in a financial year (April 1 to March 31), you're a resident for tax purposes.</p>

            <p>Residents pay tax on income earned anywhere in the world.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> You work in Bangalore earning ₹8 lakh/year + earn ₹50,000 from US freelance work. Both are taxable in India.</p>

            <h3>Income Threshold</h3>

            <p>Not everyone pays tax. Only people earning above a certain limit.</p>

            <p><strong>Basic concept:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Earn below ₹3 lakh/year → No tax (under new regime)</li>
                <li>Earn above ₹3 lakh/year → Tax starts</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Catch:</strong> Even if you earn less and owe zero tax, you might still need to FILE a return (we'll cover this later).</p>

            <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> 70% of Indian salaried employees earn below ₹5 lakh/year. Most of them pay zero or minimal tax but still file returns to claim refunds.</p>

            <h2>Types of Income You Can Be Taxed On</h2>

            <p>Income tax doesn't just apply to salary. It applies to ALL money you earn.</p>

            <h3>1. Salary</h3>

            <p>The most common source.</p>

            <p><strong>What's included:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Basic pay</li>
                <li>HRA</li>
                <li>Bonuses</li>
                <li>Allowances</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Your CTC is ₹8 lakh/year. This is taxable income (with some deductions possible under old regime).</p>

            <h3>2. Business or Profession</h3>

            <p>If you run a business, freelance, or consult, your profit is taxable.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>You freelance as a graphic designer</li>
                <li>Earn ₹12 lakh in a year</li>
                <li>Spend ₹2 lakh on software, laptop, internet</li>
                <li>Taxable income = ₹12 lakh - ₹2 lakh = ₹10 lakh</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Important:</strong> You're responsible for calculating and paying this tax yourself (not automatically deducted like salary).</p>

            <h3>3. Capital Gains</h3>

            <p>Profit from selling assets like stocks, property, gold, etc.</p>

            <p><strong>Simple example:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Bought 100 shares at ₹500 each = ₹50,000</li>
                <li>Sold at ₹700 each = ₹70,000</li>
                <li>Profit = ₹20,000 (taxable as capital gains)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Two types:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Short-term gains (sold within 1 year) - Higher tax</li>
                <li>Long-term gains (held over 1 year) - Lower tax</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We won't go into details here, but know that investment profits ARE taxed.</p>

            <h3>4. Other Income</h3>

            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Interest from savings account or FD</li>
                <li>Rent from property you own</li>
                <li>Income from side hustles</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Bank interest example:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>You earned ₹50,000 interest from FD in a year</li>
                <li>This is taxable income</li>
                <li>Must be added to your total income when filing return</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Many people forget to include bank interest. That's technically tax evasion (even if unintentional).</p>

            <h2>Old Tax Regime vs New Tax Regime (Simple Explanation)</h2>

            <p>India now has TWO tax systems. You choose one each year when filing.</p>

            <h3>Old Tax Regime</h3>

            <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Higher tax rates</li>
                <li>But allows deductions (80C for ₹1.5 lakh, HRA, home loan interest, etc.)</li>
                <li>Good if you have investments and expenses to claim</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Example benefit:</strong> You invest ₹1.5 lakh in PPF/ELSS. Under old regime, that ₹1.5 lakh is NOT taxed.</p>

            <h3>New Tax Regime</h3>

            <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Lower tax rates</li>
                <li>NO deductions (no 80C, no HRA claims)</li>
                <li>Simpler - just pay tax on your income directly</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> You earn ₹7 lakh. Under new regime, tax is calculated on full ₹7 lakh (minus standard deduction of ₹75,000). No other deductions.</p>

            <h3>Which to Choose?</h3>

            <p><strong>High-level logic:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Old regime:</strong> Better if you invest heavily (PPF, ELSS, home loan) and claim HRA</li>
                <li><strong>New regime:</strong> Better if you don't invest much or claim deductions</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Default since 2023:</strong> New regime is the default. You have to actively choose old regime if you want it.</p>

            <p><strong>Honest truth:</strong> For most young salaried people earning ₹5-10 lakh with minimal investments, new regime is simpler and often results in lower tax.</p>

            <h2>What is TDS?</h2>

            <p>TDS = Tax Deducted at Source</p>

            <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Instead of you paying tax once a year, your employer/bank deducts it BEFORE giving you money.</p>

            <h3>How It Works for Salary</h3>

            <p><strong>Your payslip flow:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Gross salary: ₹50,000/month</li>
                <li>TDS deducted: ₹3,000/month</li>
                <li>In-hand salary: ₹47,000/month</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Your employer already sent that ₹3,000 to the government on your behalf.</p>

            <p><strong>At year-end:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>You earned ₹6 lakh</li>
                <li>Employer deducted ₹36,000 as TDS</li>
                <li>You file ITR and check: Actual tax owed = ₹30,000</li>
                <li>Government refunds you ₹6,000</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Key point:</strong> TDS is advance tax. When you file ITR, final calculation happens. Excess TDS gets refunded.</p>

            <h3>TDS on Bank Interest</h3>

            <p>If your bank interest exceeds ₹40,000/year (₹50,000 for senior citizens), bank deducts 10% TDS.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>FD interest earned: ₹60,000</li>
                <li>Bank deducts ₹6,000 as TDS</li>
                <li>You receive ₹54,000</li>
                <li>When filing ITR, you report ₹60,000 and claim credit for ₹6,000 TDS</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Do You Need to File an ITR?</h2>

            <p>ITR = Income Tax Return (the form you submit to government declaring your income and tax paid)</p>

            <h3>When Filing is Mandatory</h3>

            <p>You MUST file ITR if:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Income exceeds basic exemption (₹3 lakh under new regime, ₹2.5 lakh under old)</li>
                <li>You have income from business/profession</li>
                <li>You held foreign assets</li>
                <li>You deposited more than ₹1 crore in bank accounts</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why File Even If Not Mandatory</h3>

            <p>Even if you earn ₹2 lakh/year and owe zero tax, filing ITR helps:</p>

            <h3>1. Get TDS refunds</h3>

            <p>Maybe your employer or bank deducted TDS but you don't owe tax. Filing gets you refund.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Bank deducted ₹2,000 TDS on your FD interest, but your total income is only ₹2.5 lakh (below tax threshold). File ITR, get ₹2,000 back.</p>

            <h3>2. Proof of income</h3>

            <p><strong>Needed for:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Visa applications</li>
                <li>Loan applications (home, car, education)</li>
                <li>Renting apartments</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Real scenario:</strong> Friend couldn't get education loan because he never filed ITR. Bank wanted 2 years of ITR as income proof. He earned well but had no documentation.</p>

            <h3>3. Carry forward losses</h3>

            <p>If you made losses in stock trading, you can carry them forward to offset future gains—but ONLY if you file ITR that year.</p>

            <h2>Common Income Tax Myths</h2>

            <h3>Myth 1: "Tax is only for rich people"</h3>

            <p><strong>Wrong.</strong></p>

            <p>Tax starts at ₹3 lakh/year income under new regime (₹2.5 lakh under old). That's ₹25,000/month salary. Not "rich."</p>

            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Most Indian salaried employees in cities pay some income tax.</p>

            <h3>Myth 2: "If TDS is deducted, I don't need to file ITR"</h3>

            <p><strong>Wrong.</strong></p>

            <p>TDS is just advance tax payment. Filing ITR is the FINAL settlement with the government.</p>

            <p><strong>What happens if you don't file:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>If you owe more tax, you get penalty notices later</li>
                <li>If you're owed refund, you never get it back</li>
                <li>You have no income proof for future use</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>True story:</strong> Someone didn't file ITR for 3 years despite TDS being deducted. When applying for home loan, bank rejected because of no ITR. Had to scramble to file belated returns with penalties.</p>

            <h3>Myth 3: "Filing tax is very complicated"</h3>

            <p><strong>Not anymore.</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>2015:</strong> Filing ITR meant visiting CA office, filling paper forms, waiting in lines.</li>
                <li><strong>2025:</strong> You log into income tax website or use apps like ClearTax. Pre-filled Form 26AS shows your TDS, salary. Just verify and submit.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For simple salary income, ITR filing takes 15-30 minutes.</p>

            <p><strong>Caveat:</strong> If you have capital gains, business income, or multiple income sources, it gets complex. But for first-time filers with just salary, it's straightforward.</p>

            <h2>Basic Things Beginners Should Do</h2>

            <h3>1. Get a PAN Card</h3>

            <p>PAN (Permanent Account Number) is your tax ID.</p>

            <p><strong>You need it for:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Filing ITR</li>
                <li>Opening bank accounts</li>
                <li>Buying mutual funds/stocks</li>
                <li>Any financial transaction above ₹50,000</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Apply online at incometax.gov.in or NSDL. Takes 7-10 days.</p>

            <h3>2. Link PAN with Aadhaar</h3>

            <p>Mandatory since 2023. If not linked, your PAN becomes inactive.</p>

            <p>Do it at: incometax.gov.in (free, takes 2 minutes)</p>

            <h3>3. Link Bank Account with PAN</h3>

            <p>When government processes your ITR refund, they credit your linked bank account.</p>

            <p>Check linkage at: netbanking or income tax e-filing portal</p>

            <h3>4. Keep Income Records</h3>

            <p><strong>Save these documents yearly:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Form 16 (salary certificate from employer)</li>
                <li>Bank statements (for interest income)</li>
                <li>Investment proofs (if claiming deductions)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Why:</strong> Needed when filing ITR. Also useful if tax department asks questions later.</p>

            <h3>5. Awareness, Not Optimization</h3>

            <p><strong>As a beginner, focus on:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Understanding what tax you're paying</li>
                <li>Filing ITR on time (deadline: July 31 every year)</li>
                <li>Getting refunds if owed</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Don't obsess over:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Complex tax-saving strategies</li>
                <li>Aggressive deductions</li>
                <li>Regime switching calculations</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Keep it simple. As income grows, complexity will come naturally.</p>

            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>

            <p><strong>What income tax is:</strong> Money you pay to the government based on your earnings. It funds public services and infrastructure.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it exists:</strong> Government needs revenue to function. Income tax is a major source.</p>

            <p><strong>Why beginners should understand it early:</strong> Because ignoring tax doesn't make it go away. Not filing ITR leads to penalties, missed refunds, and future problems (loans, visas, legal notices).</p>

            <p><strong>The simple truth:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>If you earn above ₹3 lakh/year, you'll likely pay some tax</li>
                <li>TDS deducts tax throughout the year</li>
                <li>Filing ITR settles the final amount (refund or payment)</li>
                <li>It's not as scary or complicated as it sounds</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Start early. File on time. Don't panic.</p>
